Have you ever wondered what it would be like to completely change the direction of your professional life? To start over in a new field that requires a ton of expertise (of which you have very little) and in a job where you will almost inevitably be at the bottom of the ladder even if you may have a long and successful career to date? 

The upside to this is that you could find your true calling and a job that isn’t just work, but a vocation. The downside is that it would be a huge investment of your time and energy and really, who knows whether it will really be that much better than what you’re doing now.  

Over the past eight days I have spent close to 100 hours with thirty people who have decided to take this leap of faith. We are learning enough programming skills to become junior developers (a job that is often filled by someone with a four-year CS degree) at the end of a 12-week course. 

I am not sure how much time you have spent with workforce development (or “workforce dev” as the former U.S. CTO Megan Smith refers to it, which I prefer as it sounds much sexier) policy wonks you know that this sort of education program is exactly the sort of thing that gets harped on. In my former role as a lead staffer for ‘workforce dev’ policy in the Obama Administration, I can’t count the number of speeches and press releases where I wrote things like “all Americans need the chance to retool and retain”.  While I was there I designed program called TechHire that the President launched in 2014, which focused specifically on giving more people the chance to go to fast-track tech training programs to get better jobs. The program is now in 70 cities with participants ranging from former coalminers in Eastern Kentucky to young people with limited formal education in NYC.  

I 100% believe that one of the most important things we can do to facilitate the success of all people in this county no matter what their background is to give them the chance to learn new skills that give them a leg up in the job market. But I have to tell you that despite all the preaching I have done (and trust me it’s been a lot) about this over the past five years, I never really thought about doing it myself.

But in January when I became unemployed, I decided to do a coding bootcamp. I signed up for the Web Development Program at the Flatiron School in New York City. Just a few weeks after leaving my job I shipped two boxes from D.C. to New York and moved into a three bedroom sublet in the West Village that is reminiscent of my college dorm. 

The past eight days have been some of the most intense of my life and I cannot remember a time when I have learned this hard (that should be a phrase – like ‘worked this hard). I wake up at 5:30am (and I am not a morning person), get into school and start coding around 6:30am, do coding and lectures until 7pm, walk home and eat, and then from 8:30pm until I go to bed I’m coding. Whew! I am tired even writing that out. 

But I have to say that I am loving it. 

So, as I go on journey I am going to write about my experience.  My hope is to accomplish a few things through this blog: 

-	Give people (if anyone reads this thing…) the scoop on what it’s like to dive head first into something totally new as a late 20 (almost early 30) something. 

-	Test some of the core assumptions that we make in workforce development policy and hopefully get some new insights.

-	And finally, I’m guessing this will be a forum to vent frustrations and share my excitement through the inevitable ups and downs of the next 11 weeks.
